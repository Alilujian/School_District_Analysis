PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview
In this project, we have create a district and school information summary. The school district found that the test scores for ninth grade studetns in Thomas High School were incorrect, so they decided to update the data to find the correct grade information. In this case, we will replace the ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School students.\
The ninth grade reading and math scores will be replaced as "NAN". There are a total number of 461 students affected. We will create a new summary sheet for the score replacements.
